# Features

This hack adds gender selection to the beginning of the game during Oak’s speech. There are two characters to choose from: Red (Boy) and Green (Girl). If you chose the female character, the player character sprite is green (in the overworld, battle screen, town map screen, trainer card, etc). All references to the player character’s gender in the games script have been gender neutralized (ie, Mom says “all boys leave home” to “all kids leave home”). The male character is red. The sprites for the girl character were made by BurstXShadowzX on DeviantArt and adapted into the rom.

This is built on the latest version of the Pokered-GBC rom. In addition to colorizing the rom, the Pokémon sprites have been replaced with their Gen 2 equivalents, back sprites expanded to 48×48 and the audio engine updated to Crystal’s.

A few other changes were made, listed below. The hack is now a “catch ‘em all” hack, in that you can get all Pokémon in a single play through, including all version exclusives and trade-evolve Pokémon are available.

The game has been play tested through to the end four times. If you find any errors, especially with the coloration or Red or Green’s sprites in-game, please leave a review stating where the issue is.

Special thanks to Danny-E33. He provided much insight into the function of his colorization code and without him the hack would not have been possible.

Note: While this hack shares inspiration from hacks like Satin and Gender Selection, it does not contain any of their code. The ASM hacking to add additional character options was written from the ground up by the author.
